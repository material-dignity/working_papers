Convert the theoretical construct of ``relational dignity'' into a field-executable engineering specification. This paper bridges the ethnographic bedrock of street-level trust formation with the neurobiological architecture of the autonomic nervous system to produce a standardized, scalable operational manual for the Material Dignity Infrastructure (MDI) street-to-home pipeline. Relational dignity is a measurable production output requiring precise structural preconditions. Sustainable transition requires replacing vertical compliance with horizontal, needs-responsive engagement grounded in consistency of return and unconditional regard. This paper operationalizes the Relational Intake Protocol through a three-state Autonomic Routing Matrix, and the Social Network Transition Protocol through a reciprocity-weighted pod assignment algorithm. The protocol's assignment weights and misclassification ceilings are explicit design parameters requiring prospective calibration through the Singular Prototype Threshold, isolating what must be built from what must be proven.

\noindent\textbf{Author's Note and Statement of Necessity}\\[1pt]
Working Paper 4 (SSRN 6881539) of this series established that the relational layer must be designed to specification, built into the operational architecture, and measured against defined thresholds. A theoretical framework without operational specifications is a research contribution without deployment capacity. This paper provides the build manual for the two operational decisions that determine whether the relational layer functions from day one of tower operation: who makes the offer and how, and who lives with whom after the offer is accepted. The Autonomic Routing Matrix is the manual for the outreach worker on the street. The Social Network Analysis pipeline is the manual for the Process 4 data administrator managing pod assignments.

The Material Dignity Infrastructure series operates as a cumulative preprint architecture in which each working paper builds on prior papers in the sequence. Citations to prior MDI working papers operate as citations to the developing theoretical framework they establish, not as citations to peer-reviewed empirical findings. Those internal assumptions await external validation through the Singular Prototype Threshold.

\section{The Ethnographic Bedrock and Theoretical Grounding}

The Autonomic Routing Matrix is a theoretical formalization of Porges's polyvagal architecture, applied to the specific contact conditions of street outreach. Longitudinal street outreach practice on Skid Row, Los Angeles provided the motivating context for this formalization. Field methodology dictates that trust is built through fixed-schedule, non-contingent material offerings (food, tobacco) that signal unconditional regard rather than incentivize behavior. The operative field protocol replaces institutional intake questions with a single inquiry: \textit{do you need anything?}

This foundational field data is partial. It systematically documents successful contact initiation rates and material exchange patterns, but lacks longitudinal tracking of autonomic state shifts and physiological baselines. It serves as the motivating context that demands the protocol, not its empirical validation. The foundation of the protocol relies on the polyvagal literature. The field observations confirm the practical necessity of applying that literature to this population: a fixed-schedule, needs-responsive methodology produced observable affective shifts across repeated encounters with chronically street-present individuals, a pattern consistent with the autonomic state-transition dynamics polyvagal theory predicts.

The critical applied finding is that approach vector, physical posture, and verbal script cannot be fixed across all contact attempts. They must match the observable neurological state of the individual at the moment of contact. Asking ``do you want to come inside?'' to an individual in dorsal-vagal shutdown is a category error because the question requires prefrontal processing capacity that the shutdown state has suspended. The offer fails not because the individual rejects housing but because the offer was made to a nervous system that cannot receive it. Polyvagal theory explains this mechanism. The Autonomic Routing Matrix operationalizes it.
